##Custom components
Every project will have its own theme and design specifications requiring some degree of custom css and js. In addition, most projects have specific functional requirements or needs in order to power the user experience.

This is one of the reasons we have pushed more of the requirements for custom work to use JS components. It is easier to find good developers and the use of components means that we can reduce overall complexity into more manageable pieces.
