- Check stored basic_data against import to only pull it in if changed
- Cache tag for basic data
-- possibly delete the basic data JSON when cache expires?
-- then this will be the trigger to pull it in new?
- performance testing
-- how well does this scale up?
-- what are the reasonable limits for quantity and frequency of updates
- Webhook option - let the ecommerce engine tell ACF when to update (and what)
- Bug: Need to clear cache after enabling or can't get to acf catalog listing
- Idea: catalog plugin that uses Migrate API to pull things in? 
-- is that a viable option?
-- does it make sense, or better to go straight Migrate API?
- test coverage
- ability to clear/purge/update single data item
-- have this re-import
- Future feature - use CH2 to import content 
-- could be faster and more efficient
