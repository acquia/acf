# Acquia Commerce Framework
Contexual commerce experiences require  multiple modes of integration with the CMS. Acquia Commerce Framework (ACF) combines Drupal as the "glass" and a decoupled e-commerce platform to power the commerce engine. The optimal structure is composed of two different approaches:

1) Cacheable data imported into the CMS.
> *Example: product data is imported as content so site builders can manage it within the site..*

2) Realtime data managed via clientside JS components.
>*Example: add to cart  button sends the request to the ecommerce API, and the cart component is updated.*

ACF is an open-source reference architecture that allows Drupal developers, Javascript developers, and site builders to create these experiences quickly.

## Support
This project is a reference architecture similar to the `examples` module. It is not intended to be used directly. Use this to inform your architecture, and to experiment with your plans very quickly. See the [external connectors document](docs/7_External_connectors.md) for more specific examples of how best to connect to your ecommerce engine.
