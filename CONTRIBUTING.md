# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, slack,or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. Alternatively, feel free to issue a pull request with your code!

We can not promise to include all requests, but we want to encourage contributions back. Your code may or may not make it into the codebase directly, but it still provides value in the issue queue and for others who come along later.

Please note that this is a community project, and we support the [Drupal Code of Conduct](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc). Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
> As our community grows, it is imperative that we preserve the things that got us here; namely, keeping Drupal a fun, welcoming, challenging, and fair place to play. The Drupal Code of Conduct (DCOC) states our shared ideals with respect to conduct. Think of this as coding standards for people. It is an expression of our ideals, not a rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to the entire community.
